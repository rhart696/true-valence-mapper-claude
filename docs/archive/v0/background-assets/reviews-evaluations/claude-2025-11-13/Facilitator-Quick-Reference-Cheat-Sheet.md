# True Valence Mapper: Facilitator Quick Reference

## 🎯 ONE-PAGE COACHING GUIDE

---

### PREPARATION (Before Session)

**Decision: Live or Async?**
- ✅ Live: Active conflict, early engagement, needs facilitation
- ✅ Async: Self-directed client, pre-session reflection, time constraints

**Set Up:**
- [ ] Send link 24-48 hours before (if async)
- [ ] Test tool yourself first
- [ ] Review client context (past patterns, current challenges)
- [ ] Prepare quiet, private space

---

### SESSION STRUCTURE (45-60 minutes)

| Phase | Time | Key Actions |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1. Setup** | 2-3 min | Frame the exercise, ensure privacy, set expectations |
| **2. Mapping** | 5-10 min | Silent observation, note non-verbals, let them drive |
| **3. First Reaction** | 3-5 min | "What do you notice?" Open-ended only. |
| **4. Deep Dive** | 15-20 min | Explore patterns: strengths → asymmetries → gaps |
| **5. Action Plan** | 10-15 min | Prioritize 1-3 relationships, identify small steps |
| **6. Close** | 3-5 min | Synthesize insights, schedule follow-up |

---

### ESSENTIAL PROMPTS (Memorize These 5)

1. **Opening:** "What do you notice?"
2. **Strengths:** "What makes these high-trust relationships work?"
3. **Asymmetry:** "What might explain these trust differences?"
4. **Priority:** "Which 1-3 relationships matter most right now?"
5. **Action:** "What's one small step you could take this week?"

---

### RESPONSE PATTERNS → INTERVENTIONS

| What Client Says | What It Might Mean | How to Respond |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| "They're all fine" | Avoidance, superficial engagement | "Let's go deeper—where's a relationship that could be stronger?" |
| "I already knew this" | Intellectualization | "What are you *feeling* as you look at this?" |
| "This is so depressing" | Overwhelm | "That's heavy. Let's find one small area of hope." |
| "It's not my fault" | Defensiveness | "I'm not blaming you. I'm curious about your experience." |
| "I can't change anything" | Learned helplessness | "What's one thing—even tiny—that's in your control?" |

---

### RED FLAGS → ESCALATE

**When to pause or refer out:**
- All relationships scored 0-1 (possible depression, trauma, neurodivergence)
- Client expresses suicidal ideation or severe hopelessness
- Evidence of workplace abuse or harassment
- Client unable to engage reflectively (acute crisis state)

**Response:** "This seems like it's touching something deeper. Would it help to talk with [mental health resource]?"

---

### FACILITATION REMINDERS

✅ **DO:**
- Stay curious, not prescriptive
- Validate all feelings
- Explore client's agency
- Connect patterns to concrete stories
- Name elephants in room gently
- Hold space for silence

❌ **DON'T:**
- Jump to solutions
- Judge their scores or relationships
- Share tool results with HR/management without consent
- Push when they resist
- Assume "low trust = bad person"
- Rush the reflection

---

### COMMON STUCK POINTS

**"I don't know how to rate them"**
→ "Use your gut. If you had to pick right now, what feels true?"

**"The trust depends on the situation"**
→ "For work challenges specifically, what's your overall comfort level?"

**"Can I add more than 8 people?"**
→ "Let's focus on quality over quantity. Who most affects your daily experience?"

**"This person will never change"**
→ "Maybe. But you can change how you engage with them. What's in your control?"

---

### CLOSING COMMITMENTS

**Always leave with:**
1. One clear insight ("My biggest takeaway is...")
2. One small action ("This week I'll...")
3. One accountability touchpoint ("We'll check in on [date]")

---

### POST-SESSION

- [ ] Document patterns you observed (for your records only)
- [ ] Note any red flags or referral needs
- [ ] Schedule follow-up
- [ ] Send recap email with their action commitments (optional)
- [ ] Debrief with supervisor if session was challenging

## 📊 PATTERN RECOGNITION CHEAT SHEET

### High Trust Everywhere (All 2-3)
**Interpret:** Strong network, possible conflict avoidance, or easy-going environment

### Low Trust Everywhere (All 0-1)
**Interpret:** Possible burnout, toxic environment, or trust issues  
**Explore:** "What's making trust so hard right now?"

### You Trust High / They Trust Low (Asymmetry)

**Explore:** "What stops them from coming to you?"

### They Trust High / You Trust Low (Asymmetry)
**Interpret:** You're guarded, they're vulnerable, or you're unsure  
**Explore:** "What would it take for you to feel safer with them?"

### One Outlier (One red, rest green)
**Interpret:** Specific relationship issue, past conflict, or mismatch  
**Explore:** "Tell me about this relationship. What's the story here?"

## 💡 ADVANCED MOVES

### The Reframe
**Client:** "I can't trust anyone here."  
**You:** "What if trust isn't binary? Where's there even 10% trust?"

### The Exception Question
**Client:** "All my relationships are bad."  
**You:** "When's a time one of these relationships worked, even briefly?"

### The Future Self
**Client:** "I don't know what to do."  
**You:** "Imagine it's 6 months from now and this has improved. What did you do?"

### The Scaling Question
**Client:** "The relationship with Sarah is terrible."  
**You:** "On a scale of 1-10, where is it now? What would move it up even one point?"

---

## 🔐 ETHICAL BOUNDARIES

**Client owns the data.** You cannot:
- Share results without explicit consent
- Use it for performance reviews
- Report to HR unless safety issue (and tell client first)

**You are a coach, not a therapist.** Refer out if:
- Client needs mental health treatment
- Issues are outside your scope
- You feel stuck or overwhelmed

---

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If client reveals:**
- Suicidal thoughts: [Crisis line]
- Workplace abuse: [HR/Legal]
- Discrimination: [Appropriate resource]
