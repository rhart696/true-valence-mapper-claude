## SECTION 1: Welcome & Context (10 min)

### Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** True Valence Mapper: Facilitator Training  
**Subtitle:** Building awareness, intentionality, and stronger workplace relationships  
**Visual:** ProActive logo + abstract network diagram

---

### Slide 2: Why This Tool Exists

**The Challenge:**
- Most professionals navigate workplace relationships reactively
- Trust dynamics are felt but rarely examined explicitly
- Relationship dysfunction affects performance, wellbeing, and retention

**The Opportunity:**
- Structured reflection creates awareness
- Awareness creates choice
- Choice creates change

**Quote:** *"You can't manage what you don't measure. You can't improve what you don't reflect on."*

---

### Slide 3: Tool Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Non-judgmental:** All relationship states are valid starting points
2. **Client-owned:** They control their data and insights
3. **Action-oriented:** Awareness must lead to behavior change
4. **Coach-supported:** Tool amplifies human facilitation, doesn't replace it

**Key Mindset:** This isn't about "fixing broken relationships"—it's about intentional relationship investment.

---

### Slide 4: Where It Fits in ProActive's Methodology

**Use Cases:**
- Early engagement: Baseline relationship assessment
- Conflict resolution: Identifying trust breakdowns
- Leadership development: Building team connection
- Career transitions: Navigating new relationship dynamics
- Check-ins: Tracking growth over time

**Integration Points:**
- Pairs well with 360 feedback
- Complements conflict mediation work
- Enhances team coaching interventions

---

## SECTION 2: Tool Walkthrough (15 min)

### Slide 5: Tool Demo - Overview

**Live Demo: Navigate to the tool and show:**

1. **Landing Experience**
   - Welcome modal on first visit
   - Privacy statement prominence
   - "How to Use" instructions

2. **Key Features Tour**
   - Add people (6-8 recommended)
   - Optional context tags
   - Trust scale (0-3, both directions)
   - Save/load functionality
   - Insights view

**Facilitator Note:** "Let's spend the next 10 minutes exploring the tool together. I'll demo first, then you'll have a chance to try it yourself."

---

### Slide 6: Understanding the Trust Scale

**Visual: Side-by-side comparison of the 4 levels**

| Score | Label | Meaning | Color | When to Use |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Not established | Trust hasn't been built yet, or I'm uncertain | 🔴 Red | New relationships, unclear dynamics |
| 1 | Low trust | I'd hesitate; only low-stakes situations | 🟠 Orange | Strained or distant relationships |
| 2 | Moderate trust | Reasonably comfortable in most situations | 🟡 Yellow | Functional but not deep relationships |
| 3 | High trust | Fully comfortable, even with difficult topics | 🟢 Green | Strong, authentic relationships |

**Coaching Tip:** The scale measures comfort bringing a *work challenge* to someone—not friendship, likability, or social connection.

---

### Slide 7: The Two Directions of Trust

**Visual: Bidirectional arrows between two people**

**OUTWARD (You → Them):**
"How comfortable would I feel bringing a work challenge to this person?"
- Measures: Your vulnerability and confidence in their support

**INWARD (Them → You):**
"How comfortable would this person feel bringing a work challenge to me?"
- Measures: Your perception of their trust in you (requires empathy/guessing)

**Why Both Matter:**
- Asymmetries reveal relationship dynamics
- Highlights where communication may be one-sided
- Shows opportunities for building reciprocity

---

### Slide 8: Hands-On Practice (10 min)

**Instructions for Participants:**

1. Open the tool on your device
2. Think of YOUR actual workplace network (yes, your real relationships!)
3. Add 3-4 people and score them honestly
4. Explore the insights view
5. Notice: What patterns emerge? Any surprises?

**Facilitator:** Circulate and answer questions. Emphasize this is private practice—they don't have to share.

**Debrief Questions:**
- "What was easy? What was hard?"
- "Did scoring 'trust from them' feel different than 'trust to them'?"
- "What did the insights view reveal?"

---

## SECTION 3: Facilitation Framework (15 min)

### Slide 9: The 6-Phase Coaching Structure

**Visual: Linear flow diagram**

```
Setup → Mapping → First Reaction → Deep Dive → Action Planning → Close
```

**Phase 1: Setup (2-3 min)**
- Frame the exercise
- Ensure privacy and safety
- Set expectations

**Phase 2: Mapping (5-10 min)**
- Let them work in silence
- Observe non-verbals
- Don't interrupt

**Phase 3: First Reaction (3-5 min)**
- "What do you notice?"
- Follow their energy
- Stay open-ended

**Phase 4: Deep Dive (15-20 min)**
- Explore strengths, asymmetries, gaps
- Use structured inquiry
- Connect to stories

**Phase 5: Action Planning (10-15 min)**
- Prioritize 1-3 relationships
- Identify small, concrete actions
- Co-create, don't prescribe

**Phase 6: Close (3-5 min)**
- Synthesize insights
- Confirm commitments
- Schedule follow-up

---

### Slide 10: The Essential 5 Prompts (Memorize These)

**Print these on facilitator cards:**

1. **Opening:** "What do you notice?"  
   *Use: First reaction phase*

2. **Strengths:** "What makes these high-trust relationships work?"  
   *Use: Deep dive - strengths exploration*

3. **Asymmetry:** "What might explain these trust differences?"  
   *Use: Deep dive - pattern analysis*

4. **Priority:** "Which 1-3 relationships matter most right now?"  
   *Use: Action planning - narrowing focus*

5. **Action:** "What's one small step you could take this week?"  
   *Use: Action planning - behavior change*

**Why These Work:**
- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Client-centered (not advice-giving)
- Forward-moving (not dwelling)

---

### Slide 11: What to Listen For

**Client Language Patterns:**

| What They Say | What It Might Mean | Your Response |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "They're all fine" | Avoidance, fear of vulnerability | "Let's go deeper. Where could a relationship be stronger?" |
| "I already knew this" | Intellectualizing to avoid feeling | "What are you *feeling* as you look at this?" |
| "This is so depressing" | Overwhelm, may need to slow down | "That's heavy. Let's find one small area of hope." |
| "It's not my fault" | Defensiveness, may feel blamed | "I'm not blaming you. Tell me about your experience." |
| "I can't change anything" | Learned helplessness | "What's one tiny thing that's in your control?" |

**Body Language Cues:**
- Sighing while scoring = emotional weight
- Long pauses = complexity or ambivalence
- Rapid scoring = avoidance or overwhelm
- Tears = vulnerability (good! but slow down)

---

### Slide 12: Dos and Don'ts

**✅ DO:**
- Stay curious, not prescriptive
- Validate all feelings ("That makes sense")
- Explore their agency and control
- Connect patterns to specific stories
- Hold space for silence (count to 10!)
- Name elephants in the room gently

**❌ DON'T:**
- Jump to solutions prematurely
- Judge their scores or relationships
- Share results without consent
- Push when they resist
- Assume "low trust = bad person"
- Rush the reflection process

**Golden Rule:** The insights must come from THEM, not you.

---

## SECTION 4: Practice Scenarios (15 min)

### Slide 13: Role Play - Scenario 1

**The Overextended People-Pleaser**

**Background:**
- Client scores "trust to them" as all 2-3 (high)
- Client scores "trust from them" as all 0-1 (low)
- Pattern: Always helping others, never asking for help

**Your Role as Coach:**
1. What question would you ask first?
2. How would you explore the asymmetry?
3. What action might you co-create?

**Partner Up:** One person plays coach, one plays client. Switch after 5 minutes.

**Debrief:**
- What questions worked well?
- What felt awkward?
- How did the client respond?

---

### Slide 14: Role Play - Scenario 2

**The Conflict-Avoidant Leader**

**Background:**
- Client is a new manager
- All direct reports scored 2-3
- One person (Taylor) scored 0/0 both directions
- Client says: "We just don't connect. I don't think they like me."

**Your Role as Coach:**
1. How do you explore without making the client defensive?
2. What assumptions might the client be making?
3. What small engagement could you suggest?

**Partner Up:** Role play for 5 minutes, then switch.

**Debrief:**
- How did you balance challenge and support?
- What made the client open up (or close down)?

---

### Slide 15: Role Play - Scenario 3

**The Toxic Work Environment**

**Background:**
- All relationships scored 0-1 (low or no trust)
- Client says: "Everyone here is terrible. I don't trust anyone."
- You sense the environment may be genuinely dysfunctional

**Your Role as Coach:**
1. How do you validate without reinforcing helplessness?
2. When do you shift from "improve relationships" to "protect yourself"?
3. What boundaries might be needed?

**Group Discussion:** 
- How do you differentiate client contribution from systemic toxicity?
- When is the answer to leave, not to fix?

---

## SECTION 5: Advanced Techniques (20 min)

### Slide 16: Dealing with Resistance

**Common Resistance Patterns:**

1. **"I don't want to rate people"**
   - Response: "I get it—ratings feel reductive. These aren't facts, they're your perceptions right now. They can change."
   - Alternative: "Want to start with just 3-4 people and see how it feels?"

2. **"The trust depends on the situation"**
   - Response: "Absolutely. For this exercise, focus on work challenges specifically. What's your overall comfort level?"

3. **"This person will never change"**
   - Response: "Maybe. But you can change how you engage with them. What's in your control?"

4. **"All my relationships are fine"**
   - Response: "Great! Are there any you'd like to strengthen, even if they're already okay?"

---

### Slide 17: Managing Strong Emotion

**If Client Becomes Tearful:**
- Slow down immediately
- Don't rush past the emotion
- "This is bringing up something important. Want to tell me what you're feeling?"
- Validate: "It makes sense this matters to you."
- Don't solve—sit with the feeling

**If Client Expresses Anger:**
- "That sounds really frustrating."
- "Help me understand what's most upsetting."
- Later: "What would help channel that frustration into action?"

**If Client Shuts Down:**
- "I notice you've gotten quiet. What's happening?"
- "We can pause anytime. Do you want to take a break?"
- "What would make this feel safer?"

**Red Flag:** If emotion is disproportionate or persistent, consider:
- Unresolved trauma
- Mental health concerns
- Need for specialist referral

---

### Slide 18: Power Dynamics & Hierarchy

**When Clients Map Their Boss:**

**Watch For:**
- Fear of judgment: "My boss should trust me more—what's wrong with me?"
- Learned helplessness: "There's nothing I can do about this"
- Boundary confusion: "They overshare and I don't know how to handle it"

**Helpful Reframes:**
- "Hierarchical relationships have different dynamics. That's not your fault."
- "You can influence this relationship even if you're not in charge of it."
- "Trust with authority figures often develops differently than peer trust."

**Coaching Moves:**
- Explore power dynamics explicitly
- Distinguish "influence" from "control"
- Discuss upward relationship management
- Consider if the boss is the problem (toxic leadership)

---

### Slide 19: When to Refer Out

**These Issues Are Beyond Your Scope:**

⚠️ **Mental Health Concerns:**
- All relationships scored 0 (possible depression)
- Suicidal ideation or severe hopelessness
- Paranoid thinking ("everyone is against me")
- Inability to engage reflectively

**Response:** "This seems like it's touching something deeper. Would it help to talk with [mental health resource]?"

⚠️ **Workplace Abuse:**
- Evidence of harassment, discrimination, or bullying
- Safety concerns (physical or psychological)
- Legal violations

**Response:** "This sounds like a situation that needs [HR/legal/EAP] support. Let's talk about next steps."

⚠️ **Scope Creep:**
- Issues primarily about personal relationships (family, romantic)
- Medical concerns affecting work relationships
- Substance abuse

**Response:** "I care about this, but it's outside my expertise. Here's who I recommend..."

---

### Slide 20: Ethical Boundaries

**You Are a Coach, Not a Therapist:**
- Coaches facilitate growth and performance
- Therapists treat mental health conditions
- Know the difference; honor the boundary

**Client Owns the Data:**
You cannot:
- Share results without explicit consent
- Use for performance reviews or HR reports
- Discuss with managers or colleagues
- Keep copies without permission

**Exception:** Mandatory reporting (harm to self/others, child abuse)
- If you must report, tell the client first
- Explain why and what will happen
- Maintain compassion

**When in Doubt:** Consult with your supervisor or ProActive leadership.

---

### Slide 21: Facilitator Self-Care

**This Work Is Emotionally Demanding:**

You're holding space for:
- Vulnerability and pain
- Disappointment and frustration
- Sometimes trauma and grief

**Protect Yourself:**
- Debrief difficult sessions with a colleague
- Don't carry their problems home
- Recognize when you're triggered
- Take breaks between sessions
- Celebrate wins (however small)

**Remember:**
- You're a guide, not a savior
- Their growth is their responsibility
- You can't want it more than they do
- It's okay to feel stuck sometimes

**Resources:**
- ProActive peer supervision group
- External coaching supervision
- Mental health resources for coaches

---

## SECTION 6: Q&A & Troubleshooting (10 min)

### Slide 22: Common Questions

**Q: "How long should a session using this tool take?"**
A: 45-60 minutes typically. 10 min mapping, 30 min exploration, 10 min action planning.

**Q: "Can I use this in team coaching?"**
A: Yes, with caution. Individual mapping is private. Anonymous aggregates can inform team discussions about patterns.

**Q: "What if a client wants to add 15 people?"**
A: Redirect to quality over quantity. "Let's focus on the 6-8 who most affect your daily experience."

**Q: "What if they score everyone as 0 or 3 (extremes only)?"**
A: Explore all-or-nothing thinking. "Is nuance hard to capture, or do relationships really feel black-and-white?"

**Q: "Can I use this for remote/async coaching?"**
A: Absolutely. Send link 24-48 hours before session. Review together live.

**Q: "How often should clients revisit their map?"**
A: Every 3-6 months for progress tracking. More frequently during active relationship work.
