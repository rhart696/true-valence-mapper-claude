# ProActive True Valence Mapper - Coach Facilitator Quick-Start Guide

**Purpose:** Help coaches effectively facilitate the True Valence Mapper tool in coaching sessions

**Audience:** ProActive coaches, therapists, and facilitators

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes for initial mapping, 10-15 minutes for follow-up sessions

---

## Quick Reference Card

### Session Flow (20 Minutes)
1. **Introduce the tool** (2-3 min) - Explain trust mapping concept
2. **Identify relationships** (3-5 min) - Client lists up to 8 key relationships
3. **Score trust levels** (8-10 min) - Facilitate scoring with reflection
4. **Explore patterns** (5-7 min) - Discuss asymmetries and insights
5. **Action planning** (3-5 min) - What shifts could improve trust?

### Key Questions to Ask
- **High asymmetry:** "What do you notice about this relationship?"
- **Low both ways:** "What would need to shift here?"
- **High one way:** "How does this imbalance feel for you?"

---

## Section 1: Pre-Session Preparation

### Before Your First Session Using the Tool

**1. Familiarize Yourself (15 minutes)**
   - Open the tool: [True Valence Mapper URL]
   - Click "Load Demo" to see sample data
   - Practice clicking arrows to change scores
   - Notice how patterns emerge visually

**2. Understand Trust Definitions**

   **Outward Trust (→):** "How confident am I that I'd go to them with a problem?"
   - Score 1 (Green/Solid): High confidence - I'd definitely go to them
   - Score 2 (Yellow/Dashed): Medium - I might go to them depending on the problem
   - Score 3 (Red/Dotted): Low - I probably wouldn't go to them

   **Inward Trust (←):** "How confident am I that they'd come to me with a problem?"
   - Same scoring system, but reversed direction
   - Helps identify asymmetric trust patterns

**3. Review Privacy & Ethics**
   - This tool is for **self-reflection and coaching**, not clinical diagnosis
   - Client data is private (local browser storage by default)
   - Optional cloud storage for sharing between sessions
   - Always get consent before using relationship mapping tools
   - Remind clients: "This is YOUR perception, not objective truth"

**4. Prepare Your Workspace**
   - Have the tool open in a browser tab
   - Ensure screen sharing is working (if remote session)
   - Have backup: pen and paper if tech fails

## Section 2: Introducing the Tool to Clients

### Opening Script (2-3 Minutes)

> "Today I'd like to introduce a tool we use called the True Valence Mapper. It helps visualize trust patterns in your relationships.
>
> Here's how it works: You'll identify up to 8 key people in your life - could be personal or professional relationships. Then we'll score trust in two directions:
>
> 1. **How confident are you that you'd go to them with a problem?** (Your trust in them)
> 2. **How confident are you that they'd come to you with a problem?** (Their trust in you, as you perceive it)
>
> The tool creates a visual map showing patterns. Often, people discover insights like:
> - 'I didn't realize how one-sided this relationship is'
> - 'I see who I really lean on now'
> - 'This shows me where I want to build more connection'
>
> Does that make sense? Any questions before we start?"

### Address Common Concerns

**Client: "What if I'm not sure about someone's trust in me?"**
> "That's completely normal. Score it based on your best perception. If you're unsure, that's valuable information in itself - maybe that's something to explore with them."

**Client: "This feels uncomfortable - am I being judgmental?"**
> "This isn't about judging people as good or bad. It's about being honest with yourself about trust patterns. Trust varies by context and that's okay. It's information, not judgment."

**Client: "What if my answers change?"**
> "They probably will! Trust is dynamic. We can save your map and revisit it in future sessions to see how things shift."

## Section 3: Facilitating the Mapping Process

### Step 1: Identify Relationships (3-5 Minutes)

**Your Role:** Help client select meaningful relationships, not just default answers.

**Facilitation Tips:**

1. **Start with open-ended questions:**
   - "When you think about your relationship network, who comes to mind?"
   - "Who are the people that matter most to you right now?"
   - "Think about both personal and professional - who do you interact with regularly?"

2. **Help them diversify:**
   - Avoid all family or all work colleagues
   - Mix of close and peripheral relationships reveals patterns
   - Include at least one person from each major life domain (if applicable)

3. **Limit to 8 maximum:**
   - "Let's start with your most important relationships - we can always do another map later"
   - Quality over quantity - 5-6 well-chosen relationships often reveal more than 8 random ones

4. **Type names into the tool as they speak**
   - This shows active listening and keeps momentum
   - Confirm spelling: "That's Sarah with an 'h', right?"

**Watch Out For:**
- ❌ Only listing "safe" relationships (all greens)
- ❌ Including people they "should" have good trust with
- ✅ Authentic choices that reflect current reality

---

### Step 2: Score Trust Levels (8-10 Minutes)

**Your Role:** Facilitate reflection, not rapid clicking. Each score is an opportunity for insight.

**Facilitation Process:**

1. **Start with an "easy" relationship**
   - Pick someone they mentioned with strong feelings
   - "Let's start with [Name]. When you think about going to them with a problem, how confident do you feel?"

2. **Use the questions explicitly:**
   - "Would you go to them with a problem? How confident?"
   - "Would they come to you? How confident?"

3. **Encourage brief reflection before scoring:**
   - Give 5-10 seconds of silence
   - Watch body language - often reveals truth before words
   - If they change their score, ask: "What made you reconsider?"

4. **Notice and name patterns as they emerge:**
   - "I'm noticing several yellow arrows to you - what do you make of that?"
   - "This is the third person with high outward but low inward - interesting pattern"

5. **Don't over-explain every score:**
   - Not every relationship needs deep discussion
   - Save deep dives for 2-3 key relationships with strong reactions

**Powerful Facilitation Questions:**

- **For high asymmetry (e.g., 1→ but 3←):**
  - "What do you notice about the trust flow here?"
  - "How does this imbalance affect you?"

- **For mutual low trust (3↔3):**
  - "This relationship shows low trust both ways - is that surprising?"
  - "What would need to shift for this to change?"

- **For mutual high trust (1↔1):**
  - "This is a strong relationship - what makes it work so well?"
  - "How could you build this kind of trust in other relationships?"

- **When client hesitates:**
  - "Take your time - what are you noticing as you think about this?"
  - "There's no right answer - what feels true for you right now?"

**Watch Out For:**
- ❌ Rushing through scores to "finish the map"
- ❌ Telling client what they "should" score
- ✅ Let silence do the work - don't fill every pause
- ✅ Trust their instinct on first answer (changing scores often = overthinking)

---

### Step 3: Explore Patterns (5-7 Minutes)

**Your Role:** Help client see the forest, not just the trees.

**Pattern Recognition Framework:**

1. **Overall Balance:**
   - "Looking at the whole map, what do you notice?"
   - "Where do you see the most green? The most red?"
   - "Are you surprised by anything?"

2. **Asymmetry Patterns:**
   - High outward, low inward: "You trust them more than they trust you"
     - Common with mentors, therapists, authority figures
     - Can indicate one-sided emotional labor
   - Low outward, high inward: "They trust you more than you trust them"
     - Common with family obligations, workplace dynamics
     - May indicate boundary issues

3. **Clusters:**
   - All professional relationships one color, all personal another
   - All family low, all friends high (or vice versa)
   - "I notice all your work relationships have this pattern - what does that tell you?"

4. **Outliers:**
   - The ONE green in a sea of yellow/red
   - The ONE red in a sea of green
   - "This person stands out - what makes them different?"

**Powerful Reflection Questions:**

- "If you had to describe this map in one sentence, what would you say?"
- "What does this map tell you about yourself?"
- "Which pattern surprises you most?"
- "Which pattern feels like 'of course, I knew that'?"
- "If you could change one arrow, which would it be and why?"

**Watch Out For:**
- ❌ Judging the client's relationships ("Wow, that's really toxic")
- ❌ Jumping to solutions before client has processed
- ✅ Curiosity over analysis: "Tell me more about that"
- ✅ Reflect what you observe, let them interpret meaning

---

### Step 4: Action Planning (3-5 Minutes)

**Your Role:** Bridge insight to action.

**Action Planning Questions:**

1. **What awareness did you gain?**
   - "What's clearer to you now that wasn't before?"
   - "What did this map confirm for you?"

2. **What might you want to shift?**
   - "If you could improve one relationship on this map, which would it be?"
   - "What's one small step that could shift a yellow to green?"

3. **What might you accept as-is?**
   - "Are there relationships here that are fine at yellow/red?"
   - "Not all relationships need to be green - what feels right for you?"

4. **Between now and next session:**
   - "What's one experiment you could try?"
   - "How might you test whether this perception is accurate?"

**Example Action Plans:**

- "I'm going to have a conversation with [Name] about feeling like the trust is one-sided"
- "I'm going to notice this pattern in real-time this week"
- "I'm going to reach out to [Green relationship] when I need support instead of going it alone"
- "I'm going to set a boundary with [Red relationship]"

**Watch Out For:**
- ❌ Overwhelming client with 8 action items (one per relationship)
- ❌ Prescribing actions: "You should talk to them"
- ✅ Client-led commitments
- ✅ Small, specific, measurable experiments

---

## Section 4: Saving & Revisiting Maps

### Save the Map

**Why Save:**
- Track trust patterns over time
- See if interventions work
- Compare before/after coaching engagement

**How to Save:**

1. **Local Save (Default - Privacy-First)**
   - Click "Save" button
   - Data stored in browser only
   - Good for: One-time use, privacy concerns

2. **Cloud Save (Sharing Across Sessions)**
   - Click "Save to Cloud"
   - Client gets a share code
   - Can reload in future sessions
   - Good for: Ongoing coaching, remote sessions

3. **Export to JSON**
   - Click "Export"
   - Saves file client can email you
   - Good for: Record-keeping, switching devices

**Privacy Reminder:**
> "Your map is private. If you save to the cloud, only you (and anyone you share the code with) can see it. I recommend using first names or initials for extra privacy."

### Follow-Up Sessions

**Revisiting the Map (10-15 minutes):**

1. **Reload saved map or ask client to recreate**
2. **Compare to previous version:**
   - "What's different since last time?"
   - "Have any scores shifted?"
   - "Did you try any experiments we discussed?"
3. **Update scores in real-time:**
   - "Let's update this as we talk - does this still feel accurate?"
4. **Track progress:**
   - "Look at this shift from red to yellow - what changed?"

---

## Section 5: Advanced Facilitation Techniques

### For Deeper Work

**1. Role Reversal Exploration**
   - "If [Name] were filling this out about you, what would they score?"
   - Reveals projection, blind spots

**2. Desired State Mapping**
   - "Create a second map: Where do you WANT these to be in 6 months?"
   - Gap analysis for growth areas

**3. Historical Mapping**
   - "How would this map have looked 5 years ago?"
   - Reveals patterns of growth or decline

**4. Contextual Mapping**
   - "Let's do one for work relationships only, then one for personal"
   - Reveals domain-specific patterns

### Handling Difficult Moments

**Client becomes emotional:**
- ✅ Normalize: "This work can bring up feelings - that's okay"
- ✅ Pause: "Would you like to take a moment?"
- ✅ Validate: "It makes sense this is affecting you"
- ❌ Rush through: "Let's just finish the map"

**Client reveals concerning relationship:**
- ✅ Explore safety: "Do you feel safe in this relationship?"
- ✅ Assess for abuse: Use your professional training
- ✅ Refer if needed: This tool doesn't replace crisis intervention
- ❌ Ignore red flags

**Client resists the tool:**
- ✅ Offer choice: "We don't have to use this if it doesn't feel right"
- ✅ Explore resistance: "What about this doesn't feel helpful?"
- ✅ Adapt: Maybe start with 3 relationships instead of 8
- ❌ Force it: "Everyone else likes it"

## Section 6: Troubleshooting

### Common Technical Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't load saved map | Check if using same browser/device; try "My Maps" |
| Share code not working | Verify code is correct (case-sensitive, with dashes) |
| Arrows not clickable | Refresh page; check if browser is up-to-date |
| Map looks crowded | Limit to 6 relationships max for clarity |

### Common Facilitation Challenges

**"I don't know how to score this"**
- ✅ "Go with your gut - your first instinct is usually right"
- ✅ "If you're unsure, that's valuable information"

**"These scores feel harsh"**
- ✅ "Yellow and red aren't bad - they're just honest"
- ✅ "This is about trust patterns, not judging people"

**"This changes depending on the day"**
- ✅ "Score it based on today - we can revisit next session"
- ✅ "Trust is dynamic - that's why we track it over time"

**"I feel guilty about the red scores"**
- ✅ "You're allowed to have boundaries and protect your trust"
- ✅ "Red doesn't mean you don't love them - it means trust is different"

---

## Section 7: Ethics & Best Practices

### Professional Boundaries

✅ **DO:**
- Use as ONE tool among many in your coaching toolkit
- Get client consent before using relationship mapping tools
- Maintain confidentiality of client maps
- Refer to licensed therapist if clinical issues emerge
- Document that you used this tool in session notes

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use for clinical diagnosis (this isn't a clinical assessment)
- Promise outcomes ("This will fix your relationships")
- Share client maps without explicit permission
- Use if client is in crisis (use crisis protocols instead)
- Rely solely on this tool for complex relationship issues

### Privacy & Data Protection

1. **Client Choice:**
   - Explain local vs. cloud storage options
   - Default to local (more private)
   - Cloud only if client wants to share or track over time

2. **Anonymization:**
   - Suggest using first names or initials
   - Don't require full names

3. **Screen Sharing:**
   - If remote, ask permission before screen sharing client's map
   - Consider having client share THEIR screen instead

4. **Record Keeping:**
   - If you save maps for records, store securely
   - Follow HIPAA/privacy regulations in your jurisdiction
   - Delete old maps per retention policy

## Section 8: Sample Session Scripts

### Opening (First-Time User)

> "Today I want to introduce you to a visual tool we use called the True Valence Mapper. It's going to help us see patterns in how trust flows in your relationships - both how you trust others, and how you perceive their trust in you.
>
> We'll start by identifying up to 8 key people in your life. Then we'll score trust in two directions using this simple question: 'How confident am I that I'd go to them with a problem?' and vice versa.
>
> The tool creates a visual map - kind of like a relationship ecosystem. Most people find it reveals something they hadn't consciously noticed before.
>
> Sound good? Any questions before we start?"

### Transition to Scoring

> "Okay, we've got your 6 relationships listed. Now we're going to score each one. I'll help you think through this, but trust your instinct - there's no wrong answer.
>
> Let's start with [Name]. Think about this question: 'How confident am I that I'd go to them with a problem?'
>
> 1 = Green = High confidence, I'd definitely go to them
> 2 = Yellow = Medium, depends on the problem
> 3 = Red = Low, I probably wouldn't
>
> What feels true for you?"

### Exploring Patterns

> "Take a look at the whole map now. [Pause 10 seconds]
>
> What do you notice? What jumps out at you?
>
> [Client shares]
>
> I'm noticing [pattern]. Tell me more about that."

### Closing & Action Planning

> "This has been really rich - thank you for being so honest with yourself. Before we wrap up, I want to ask:
>
> 1. What's one thing that's clearer to you now?
> 2. Is there one relationship you'd like to focus on between now and our next session?
> 3. What's one small experiment you could try?
>
> We'll save this map and revisit it next time to see what's shifted."

## Appendix B: Trust Pattern Interpretation Guide

| Pattern | What It Might Mean | Questions to Ask |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| High both ways (1↔1) | Mutual, reciprocal trust | "What makes this work so well?" |
| High out, low in (1→3) | One-sided support | "How does this imbalance feel?" |
| Low out, high in (3→1) | They trust you more | "What prevents you from trusting them?" |
| Low both ways (3↔3) | Distant or damaged relationship | "Is this okay, or something to address?" |
| All greens | Strong network OR avoidance of tough relationships | "Anyone missing from this map?" |
| All reds | Isolation OR very high standards | "What would green look like for you?" |
| Work vs. personal split | Different trust in different domains | "What's different about work relationships?" |

---

## Quick Reference: Trust Score Meanings

| Score | Color | Pattern | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Green | Solid | High trust - I'd definitely go to them |
| 2 | Yellow | Dashed | Medium - Depends on the situation |
| 3 | Red | Dotted | Low - I probably wouldn't go to them |
| 0 | Gray | Long dash | Not yet scored |
