# True Valence Mapper - Executive Summary for Decision
**Date:** 2025-01-14
**For:** ProActive ReSolutions Leadership
**Decision Required:** Proceed with Phase 0 validation or explore Miro alternative

## TL;DR - The Bottom Line

After comprehensive expert review including adversarial critique from Red Team and Black Hat thinking:

**The #1 Question to Answer:**
> **"Why not just use Miro + ProActive-branded templates?"**
>
> **Miro cost:** $180/year
> **Custom build cost:** $28K + $12-18K/year ongoing
>
> **That's 100x more expensive over 5 years.**

**If you cannot articulate SPECIFIC value your custom tool provides that Miro cannot, you have your answer: Use Miro.**

## What Changed After Expert Critiques

### Original Plan
- Assumed building was the answer
- $10-14K validation → $22-32K total
- 12-14 weeks to production
- Measured coach activity

### Final Optimized Plan
- **Proves PROBLEM before testing solution**
- **$6-9K validation → $11-34K total** (path-dependent)
- **6 weeks to informed decision**
- **Measures CLIENT outcomes**
- **Four solution paths:** build/partner/buy/hybrid

---

## The New Approach: Problem-First, Not Solution-First

### Phase 0: Prove the Problem ($2-3K, 2 weeks)

**Critical Activities:**
1. Talk to insurance company FIRST (could be immediate blocker)
2. Shadow 5 coaches - observe real workflow
3. Survey 20-30 coaches (internal + external)
4. Prototype Miro template - test if it solves 80% of need
5. Interview coaches already using Miro

**GO Criteria (ALL must be true):**
- ✅ 75%+ coaches report SPECIFIC pain with current tools
- ✅ Miro template doesn't solve 80% of need
- ✅ Insurance covers tool without prohibitive premium
- ✅ 5+ coaches commit to weekly use

**NO-GO Criteria (ANY triggers stop):**
- ❌ Miro solves the need → Use Miro, save $28K
- ❌ Insurance won't cover
- ❌ Can't identify specific problem custom tool solves

---

### Phase 1: Test Solutions ($4-6K, 4 weeks)
**Only if Phase 0 proves problem**

**Critical Activities:**
1. Build THROWAWAY prototype (expect to discard)
2. 10 coaches minimum, 30+ data points
3. **A/B test:** 5 coaches use custom, 5 use Miro
4. Measure CLIENT outcomes (not just coach satisfaction)

**GO Criteria:**
- ✅ Custom tool shows **2X better CLIENT outcomes** than Miro
- ✅ 60%+ coaches use in 50%+ sessions
- ✅ Clear ROI justifies $18-25K investment

**NO-GO Criteria:**
- ❌ Miro performs comparably → Use Miro
- ❌ Clients see no benefit
- ❌ Can't prove ROI

---

### Decision Point: Week 6, $6-9K Invested

**Four Paths Forward:**

| Path | Cost | When to Choose |
|------|------|----------------|
| **A) BUILD** | $18-25K + $12-18K/yr | Proven 2x better + no alternatives |
| **B) PARTNER** | $5-10K + $0/yr | Valuable but outside competency |
| **C) BUY** | $10-20K + $3-8K/yr | Similar tool exists |
| **D) HYBRID** | $8-12K + $4-6K/yr | Miro works for 80% |

**OR STOP** if Miro/alternatives are sufficient

---

## 5-Year Cost Comparison

| Option | Year 1 | Years 2-5 | **5-Year Total** |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Miro templates** | $180 | $720 | **$900** |
| **Hybrid** | $12K | $24K | **$36K** (40x more) |
| **White-label** | $18K | $32K | **$50K** (56x more) |
| **Build custom** | $28K | $60K | **$88K** (98x more) |

**Question:** Is owning the platform worth 40-100x premium over Miro?

---

## Critical Insights from Red Team + Black Hat

### What They Found Wrong with Previous Plans

1. **Validation was theater** - Small sample, internal bias, no comparison to alternatives

2. **Assumed building was the answer** - Never seriously asked "Why not Miro?"

3. **Measured wrong success** - Coach adoption vs client outcomes

4. **Cost estimates optimistic** - Missing maintenance burden, legal costs

5. **No exit strategy** - What if it fails after $28K invested?

### Their Verdict

> "If you can't articulate SPECIFIC value custom tool provides that Miro can't, you have your answer: Use Miro."

---

## Decision Required This Week

### Option 1: Proceed with Phase 0 ($2-3K)
**Choose this if:**
- You can articulate SPECIFIC value custom tool provides vs Miro
- You're willing to honestly accept "use Miro" if that's what data shows
- You have project owner (15-20hrs/week) identified
- Insurance company conversation goes well

**Timeline:** 2 weeks to Phase 0 decision

---

### Option 2: Explore Miro Alternative (Immediate)
**Choose this if:**
- You cannot articulate specific value vs Miro
- You want to test cheapest option first
- You prefer to avoid software development burden
- Core competency is coaching, not software

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to prototype Miro template

---

### Option 3: Pause & Research (Low cost)
**Choose this if:**
- Need more information before decision
- Want to talk to insurance first
- Want to survey coaches informally
- Not ready to commit resources

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks research, then decide

---

## Prerequisites Before Proceeding

### Must-Have Answers

1. **Insurance Coverage**
   - Talk to insurance company THIS WEEK
   - Will they cover workplace relationship tool?
   - What's premium increase?
   - If no coverage or huge premium: **STOP**

2. **Project Owner**
   - Named individual (not "the team")
   - 15-20 hours/week protected time
   - Authority to make decisions
   - If no owner: **DON'T START**

3. **External Advisor**
   - Makes go/no-go decisions
   - Prevents sunk cost bias
   - Could be: consultant, board member, external coach
   - If no advisor: **BIAS WILL CREEP IN**

4. **The Miro Question**
   - "Why not Miro + templates?"
   - Need SPECIFIC answer, not vague "ours is better"
   - If can't answer: **USE MIRO**

5. **Risk Tolerance**
   - OK spending $6-9K to learn "don't build"?
   - Commit to honest decision based on data?
   - Accept NO-GO as success (avoided $28K waste)?
   - If not OK with this: **DON'T START**

## Recommendation

### IMMEDIATE: This Week
1. ☎️ **Call insurance company** (could be instant decision maker)
2. 💬 **Answer the Miro question** with leadership
3. 👤 **Identify project owner** and external advisor
4. 📊 **Informal survey** of 5-10 coaches: "What tool do you use for relationship mapping? What works? What doesn't?"

### THEN: Based on Results
**If insurance OK + can answer Miro question:**
→ Proceed to Phase 0 ($2-3K, 2 weeks)

**If insurance problematic OR can't answer Miro question:**
→ Explore Miro template option (1-2 weeks, $200)

**If need more info:**
→ Pause, do informal research (2-4 weeks, minimal cost)

---

## The Critical Question (One More Time)

### "Why not just use Miro + ProActive-branded templates?"

**Weak Answers** (not specific enough):
- ❌ "Our tool would be better designed"
- ❌ "Coaches would prefer our tool"
- ❌ "We'd own the platform"
- ❌ "It would be customized to our methodology"

**Strong Answers** (specific, provable):
- ✅ "Miro doesn't capture bidirectional trust (inward/outward arrows) which is core to our methodology"
- ✅ "Miro doesn't integrate with our coaching session notes and action planning"
- ✅ "We tested Miro with 5 coaches and they all hit these 3 specific limitations..."
- ✅ "Client outcomes with Miro were 50% worse than our prototype in pilot"

**If you can't give a strong answer with specifics, you have your answer: Use Miro.**

## Next Steps

### This Week
- [ ] Talk to insurance company
- [ ] Answer "Why not Miro?" question with specifics
- [ ] Identify project owner (15-20hrs/week)
- [ ] Identify external advisor for decisions
- [ ] Informal survey: 5-10 coaches about current tools

### Decision Point: End of Week
- **Green light:** All prerequisites met → Proceed to Phase 0
- **Yellow light:** Need more info → Do research phase
- **Red light:** Insurance issue or can't answer Miro question → Explore Miro

---

## Final Word

This is **NOT a "should we build software?" decision**.

This is a **"what's the best way to help our coaches improve client outcomes?" decision**.

Software might be the answer. Or Miro might be the answer. Or a simple PDF template might be the answer.

**The goal is client outcomes, not owning a platform.**

Spend $2-3K to find out which path is best. That's smart risk management.

Spending $28K assuming build is the answer without testing alternatives? That's how good companies waste money.
